# # Exercise 2
# 
# For our in class exercise you programmed a little
# function to compute the allele frequency in the next 
# generation, $p'$, due to natural selection.
# I'd like you to use this function to explore the 
# _sojourn time_ of a selected mutation in the population.
# The sojourn time is the amount of time it takes for the allele
# to go from some initial frequency, $p_0$, to frequency 1 (fixation) in a population. 
# 
# For this exercise, make a plot of sojourn time as a function of
# the selection coefficient $s$ for perhaps 100 values of $s$
# from between zero and one, with a starting frequency $p_0 = 0.001$.
