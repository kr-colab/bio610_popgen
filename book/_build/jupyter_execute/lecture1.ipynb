    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Population Genetics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Population genetics is primarily concerned with the genetic basis of\n",
    "evolution. Through a quantitative description of the dynamics of genetic\n",
    "variation within and between populations, population genetics has\n",
    "established both a descriptive and predictive understanding of how DNA,\n",
    "proteins, and genomes should differ among individuals. This leads to the\n",
    "*ultimate* definition of evolution- the change in the genetic makeup\n",
    "(allele and genotype frequencies) of a population over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population genetics is distinct from nearly every other discipline in\n",
    "biology in that important results are often theoretical, rather than\n",
    "observational or experimental. The reason for this is that the object of\n",
    "study, changes in genotype frequencies and fitnesses over time, are very\n",
    "hard to observe in the lifetime of a human. If the relevant time frame\n",
    "for evolutionary change is on the order of hundreds of thousands or\n",
    "millions of years, than directly observing changes in genotypic\n",
    "frequencies is impossible. Instead, population geneticists rely on\n",
    "elegant mathematical models, first pioneered in the early part of the\n",
    "20th century by Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane, that\n",
    "describe the changes of genotype frequencies as a result of evolutionary\n",
    "forces. Progress is made by constructing population genetic models,\n",
    "examining their behavior, and looking to see if the state of populations\n",
    "is consistent with this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, genetic variation within populations is shaped by the\n",
    "combined actions of predictable, **deterministic** evolutionary forces\n",
    "and random, **stochastic** forces. The deterministic forces are\n",
    "sometimes referred to as \"linear pressures\\\" in that they tend to push\n",
    "allele frequencies in one direction (towards one, towards zero, or\n",
    "towards an intermediate frequency). Important forces of this nature are\n",
    "selection, mutation, gene flow, meiotic drive (unequal transmission of\n",
    "certain alleles \\[a form of selection\\]), nonrandom mating (also a form\n",
    "of selection). The primary stochastic evolutionary force is genetic\n",
    "drift (potentially) which is due to the random sampling of individuals\n",
    "(and genes) in finite populations. It is important to realize that the\n",
    "deterministic forces may act together or against one another (e.g.,\n",
    "selection may \"try\\\" to eliminate an allele that is pushed into the\n",
    "population by recurrent mutation). Moreover, deterministic forces may\n",
    "act with or against genetic drift, to determine the frequencies of\n",
    "alleles and genotypes in populations (e.g., gene flow tends to\n",
    "homogenize different populations while drift tends to make them\n",
    "different). Hence, the interaction of these forces is what we are really\n",
    "interested in (a later lecture), but since this can get very complex\n",
    "mathematically, we will start by analyzing one force at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Genotype and Allele Frequencies \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin we need to understand some simple population genetic\n",
    "\"bookkeeping.\\\" Consider a locus with two alleles (alternative forms of\n",
    "the DNA sequence that \"reside\\\" at that locus, e.g., one from mother\n",
    "other from father). Now consider a population of N individuals\n",
    "(N=population size); this means that there are 2N alleles in the\n",
    "population. We can thus talk about genotype frequencies and allele\n",
    "frequencies. Let's turn our attention to a hypothetical locus, the $A$\n",
    "locus. We will first assume that there are two alleles segregating at\n",
    "the $A$ locus, $A_1$ and $A_2$. These could be two allozyme alleles\n",
    "(i.e. fast vs. slow) or two variant nucleotides at a polymorphic\n",
    "position in a genome (i.e. a SNP). Three genotypes are possible at the\n",
    "$A$ locus: two homozygous genotypes, $A_1A_1$ and $A_2A_2$, and one\n",
    "heterozygous genotype $A_1A_2$. We write the relative frequency of a\n",
    "genotype as $x_{ij}$ as this table shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  | Genotype:             | $A_1A_1$   | $A_1A_2$   | $A_2A_2$\n",

    "As relative frequencies must add to one we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    x_{11} + x_{12} + x_{22} = 1 \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The subscripting of the heterozygotes is of course arbitrary. Following\n",
    "my old advisor John Gillespie, we will take the convention of referring\n",
    "to the heterozygote as $x_{12}$ rather than $x_{21}$ -- you can only use\n",
    "one subscripting convention if you want to keep things straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in population genetics we are interested in allele frequencies\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways to think about $p$, the frequency of the $A_1$\n",
    "allele. The first way is as the relative frequency of the $A_1$ allele\n",
    "among all of the (two) alleles at the $A$ locus in our population. This\n",
    "is simple enough to get one's head around. The second way to think about\n",
    "$p$ is as the probability that an allele picked by random from the\n",
    "population is the $A_1$ allele. Picking an allele at random is actually\n",
    "composed of two parts, 1) picking a genotype at random from the\n",
    "population and 2) then picking an allele from that genotype at random.\n",
    "With our three genotypes at the $A$ locus we could write down $p$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    p =  (x_{11}\\times1) + (x_{12}\\times\\frac{1}{2}) + (x_{22}\\times0).\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression for $p$ is broken down into three terms which reveal the\n",
    "three mutually exclusive ways to sample an $A_1$ allele from the\n",
    "population and their associated probabilities. Let's consider the first\n",
    "term in this sum. This represents the joint event where we sample an\n",

    "$x_{11}$) and then sample an $A_1$ allele from that individual (this\n",

    "then sampling an $A_1$ allele (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$). Now ask\n",
    "yourself, what is that zero doing in the third term?? Got it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a concrete example to drive this all home. Consider a\n",

    "population size. For example, $x_{12} = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.5$. Now let's\n",

    "# The Hardy-Weinberg Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best known population genetic model is the famous\n",

    "genotype frequencies at an autosomal locus in an equilibrium randomly\n",
    "mating population. By equilibrium we mean a population that is *not*\n",
    "undergoing evolutionary forces such as selection, mutation, or genetic\n",
    "drift. By randomly mating we mean that individuals mate with each other\n",
    "irrespective of relatedness or geography. Populations where cousins mate\n",
    "are not randomly mating- this is called inbreeding. Populations where\n",
    "$A_1A_1$ individuals are more likely to mate with other $A_1A_1$\n",
    "individuals are not randomly mating- we call this assortative mating.\n",
    "Similarly if one is more likely to mate with their neighbors,\n",
    "geographically, than this too is not random mating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to envision an honest to goodness Hardy-Weinberg\n",
    "population is as hermaphrodite, broadcast spawners, something like\n",
    "sponges or corals. Individuals produce both sperm and eggs, and randomly\n",
    "let them go into the environment to meet up and form zygotes. In this\n",
    "way the probability of forming an $A_1A_1$ zygote is the product of the\n",
    "probability of choosing an $A_1$ egg, $p$, and the probability of\n",
    "choosing an $A_1$ sperm (these probabilities are identical because of\n",
    "our assumption of hermaphrodites). Thus the probability of randomly\n",
    "forming an $A_1A_1$ zygote is $p^2$. By similar reasoning, the\n",
    "probability of forming an $A_2A_2$ zygote is $q^2$. There are two ways\n",
    "to form an $A_1A_2$ heterozygote. The first way is with an $A_1$ sperm\n",
    "and an $A_2$ egg. This probability is $pq$. The second way would be with\n",
    "an $A_2$ sperm and an $A_1$ egg. Again, this probability is $pq$.\n",
    "Because we sum mutually exclusive probabilities, the total probability\n",
    "of randomly forming a heterozygote is $2pq$. Congratulations, you've\n",

    "\"amount\\\" of variation that exists at the genetic level is to describe a\n",
